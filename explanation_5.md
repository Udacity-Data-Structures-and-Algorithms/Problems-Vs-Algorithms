## Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

### Explanation

The problem is to implement an autocomplete feature using a trie data structure. The trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. The trie is used to store the words in the dictionary. The trie is built by inserting the words in the dictionary into the trie. The trie is then used to find the words that match the prefix entered by the user. The trie is traversed to find the words that match the prefix. The words that match the prefix are then returned as autocomplete suggestions.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of building the trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the dictionary and m is the length of the longest word in the dictionary. The time complexity of finding the words that match the prefix is O(m), where m is the length of the prefix entered by the user.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of building the trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the dictionary and m is the length of the longest word in the dictionary. The space complexity of finding the words that match the prefix is O(m), where m is the length of the prefix entered by the user.
