## Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

### Explanation

The Dutch National Flag Problem is a problem in computer science that asks to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The Dutch National Flag Algorithm is a linear-time sorting algorithm that solves the Dutch National Flag Problem. The algorithm is based on the partition operation of the quicksort algorithm. The algorithm works by maintaining three pointers: low, mid, and high. The low pointer points to the first element of the array, the mid pointer points to the current element being processed, and the high pointer points to the last element of the array. The algorithm works by iterating over the array and moving the elements to their correct positions. The algorithm works by comparing the current element with the pivot element and swapping the elements to their correct positions. The algorithm works by moving the low pointer to the right if the current element is 0, moving the mid pointer to the right if the current element is 1, and moving the high pointer to the left if the current element is 2. The algorithm works by iterating over the array until the mid pointer is greater than the high pointer.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Dutch National Flag Algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the Dutch National Flag Algorithm is O(1), as the algorithm does not use any extra space and performs the sorting in-place.
