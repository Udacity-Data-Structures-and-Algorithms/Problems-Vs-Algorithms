## Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

### Explanation

The function `get_min_max` takes an unsorted array of integers and returns a tuple of the minimum and maximum values in the array. The function makes a single pass through the array, comparing each element to the current minimum and maximum values. 

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the function is O(1), as the function uses only a constant amount of extra space.
